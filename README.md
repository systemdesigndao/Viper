# TON Viper

![ton-viper logo](/ton-viper-logo.jpg)

**TON Viper** â€“ a private messenger built on the decentralized transport layer of TON (ADNL protocol). 

**Viper** here represents rapidity, stealth, and flexibility.

It uses a relay server to forward messages between participants globally.

## Highlights

ðŸ”¹ Chat anywhere â€“ send messages across countries instantly.

ðŸ”¹ Encrypted messages â€“ only you and your peer can read them; the relay does not know the content.

ðŸ”¹ No registration â€“ just your private/public keys to start.

ðŸ”¹ Simple and fast â€“ command-line interface, lightweight and distraction-free.

**Rolling Closed Beta** â€“ currently in private testing with early adopters.
